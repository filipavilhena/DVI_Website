      <div class="context_container">
        <p> This platform was developed in the scope of the master's degree project "Participation in Dynamic Visual Identities".
        </br>
          The dissertation focuses on Dynamic Visual Identities (DVI's) as its main research area, with a particular emphasis on participation and it aimed to investigate participatory practices in Visual Identity Systems, as well as the participation's particular characteristics. 
        </br>
        </br>
          This platform's goal is to disseminate the produced knowledge and make it directly accessible to design practice. It brings together the identities and related information gathered and analysed during the research, presented in a gallery. You can use the filter system to search for and find references for your projects. In this way, this platform allows the exploration of the developed work, contributing to both research purposes and to the creation of new Participatory Visual Identities. Furthermore, it contributes to the ongoing discussion related to participation and dynamism in design. </p>

      <h3 id="taxonomy_title">The Filter System</h3>
      <div class="context_container">
        <p> The filter system created is based on the taxonomy developed within the project. This taxonomy identifies and classifies aspects related to participation in visual identities and allowed for the establishment of an analysis model for DVIs.
